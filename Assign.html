<p>Q 1:  Ans: Python is an object-oriented programming language. It allows us to develop applications using an Object Oriented   approach. In Python, we can easily create and use classes and objects.</p>

<p> Major principles of object-oriented programming system are given below.</p>

<p> Object.  Class.  Method.  Inheritance.  Polymorphism.  Data Abstraction.  Encapsulation.</p>

<p>Q 2:  Ans: 1. Modularity for easier troubleshooting.  2. Reuse of code through inheritance.  3. Flexibility through polymorphism.  4. Effective problem solving.</p>

<p>Q 3: Ans: Python method is called on an object, unlike a function. ... Since we call a method on an object, it can access the  data within it. A method may alter an object's state, but Python function usually only operates on it,and then  prints something or returns a value.</p>

<p>Q 4: Ans: Class:  A class is a virtual entity and can be seen as a blueprint of an object.  i.e:  class Employee:   id = 10;   name = &quot;usama&quot;   def display (self):   print(self.id,self.name) </p>

<p> Object:  The object is the instance of a class. The process of creating an object can be called as instantiation.  i.e:  <object-name> = <class-name>(<arguments>) </p>

<p> Attribute:  Class attributes belong to the class itself they will be shared by all the instances. Such attributes are  defined in the class body parts usually at the top, for legibility. Unlike class attributes, instance attributes   are not shared by objects.  i.e:  class sampleclass:   count = 0 # class attribute     def increase(self):   sampleclass.count += 1    # Calling increase() on an object   s1 = sampleclass()   s1.increase()   print s1.count     # Calling increase on one more   # object   s2 = sampleclass()   s2.increase()   print s2.count     print sampleclass.count </p>

<p> Behavior:  Attributes are the characteristics of the class that help to distinguish it from other classes. Behaviors are the tasks that an object performs.  A person's attributes, for example, include their age, name, and height,  while their behaviors include the fact that a person can speak, run, walk, and eat.   Q 5: Ans:  class Car:   model = &quot;prosmatic&quot;   color =&quot;Black&quot;  name = &quot;Civic&quot;   def display1 (self):   print(self.name)   def display2 (self):   print(self.madel)   def display3 (self):   print(&quot;self.color)  ob1 = Car()  ob2 = Car() ob3 = Car() ob4 = Car() ob5 = Car() ob1.display1()  ob1.display2() ob1.display3() ob2.display1()  ob2.display2() ob2.display3() ob3.display1()  ob3.display2() ob3.display3() ob4.display1() ob4.display2()  ob4.display3()  ob5.display1()  ob5.display2()  ob5.display3() </p>
